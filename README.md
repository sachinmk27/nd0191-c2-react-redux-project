# Employees Poll App

This is an application that employees can use internally. Every employee can access the application and create a poll with two proposed solutions. Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions have the most votes. In addition, there is a dashboard view that lists every employee ordered by the number of polls they've created and answered. To give employees incentive to use your application, there is a leaderboard view for the top employees who have created and answered the most polls.
